5/20 ---------
    * FIXED the first letter block: my .ToLower() was not early enough, so the capital letter was cut off
    * FIXED total by changing the type of dictionary AND using a list with LINQ methods .Sum()
        * will need to provide these tips (especially the LINQ and .Sum() method)

    * I have the basic score template, now I need to add the other 2.
    * BLOCK/QUESTION: do I need to be using methods?  Can I turn this into a method?
        * JS is all about those functions, so this should probably be too.  Maybe?
        * at the time of this assignment we are: NOT in classes, so methods would be static

    NEXT STEPS:
    * try making a method for scoring?
        *returning an int value, so this could work...
Done -> * take user input for word  
    * create score options:
        0 - Scrabble: The traditional scoring algorithm.
        1 - Simple Score: Each letter is worth 1 point.
        2 - Bonus Vowels: Vowels are worth 3 pts, and consonants are 1 pt.
            (currently these are held in an array)
    * create exit strategy: "STOP" (if or while? tied in with input)
  

5/19 ========
    * okay, don't need the oldScoreKeeper to actually work.  Need to USE it as is to flip the dictionary
    * will need to split the string, remove the commas, and repurpose as individual keys

    * Leaving off:  was able to reverse the dictionary
        * newScoreKeeper is holding the switched oSK
        * able to call nSK and compare to test word
        * BLOCK:  not picking up first letter of testWord YET.  not able to total up score YET




5/18 ---------
    * created dictionary object with 2 KVPs to test
    * able to loop through the values using nested foreach when all in Main method
    * but not able to tally keys
        ## try: what if placed keys in array, then they become ints not keys, use for loop accumulator?


    * Goals:
        * create dictionary -- <int, string>
            * what about a dictionry of lists??
        * search dictionary for desired char -- method: Contains Value
        * update score -- use key to update score variable
